## Background

This repository is a first contribution, entirely written in typescript. Firstly used as helpers for projects I was working on, I decided to release it to others.

## Installation (not available)

You need to have node >12 installed with npm (or yarn). 

In your project folder (where is located your packages.json file) type:

```shell
npm install Jeepayjipex/array-utils
```
or
```shell
yarn add Jeepayjipex/array-utils
```


## Usage

Just import the method you need and call it.
Those methods consist of pure functions only. 

It means that they'll never mutate your arrays.

They also doesn't attach any behavior to existing objects or types, avoiding unecessary consequences.

### Get methods
### Set methods
### Delete methods
